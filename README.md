# Machine-Learning--Travel-Expert-system
In this report, we will cover various aspects of our knowledge engineering project which is based on  travel recommendations for the state of North Carolina. We briefly discuss how the system works in  relation to the Travel and Tourism industry, as well as our knowledge extraction process of observing  and interviewing our travel agents, which are experts in this industry. They were able to assist us in the  development of criteria to use for our system in order to make accurate recommendations to end-users.  We will also be covering the detailed development of our system in Exsys Corvid by explaining the  specific rules of the system, review of our system by our industry expert, and our overall experience  using the software, including the limitations we faced. We will explain the various scenarios given by our  expert to test our system’s accuracy and how the outcomes compare to the decisions and  recommendations made by the travel agent expert. Thus, in this report we developed “NC Travel  Recommendation Expert System” using Corvid software
